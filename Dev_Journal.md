# Dev Journal

One entry per committed step: what was done and why. Newest at the bottom. Entries are committed separately from the work they describe (see CLAUDE.md rule 3).

## Step 0 — Repo bootstrap (`c7d4622`, 2026-10-01)

**What:** Initialised the git repo with `main` (production) and `develop` (working branch). Added `CLAUDE.md` (process rules, stack, security invariants, current status) and a strict `.gitignore` (`.env*` ignored, `.env.example` allowed).

**Why:** Fixing the working agreement before any code exists is cheaper than retrofitting it. The `.gitignore` goes in the very first commit so a secret can never be committed "by accident, once". The security invariants (token never reaches the browser, LLM never writes or posts the log) are written down now so every later design decision can be checked against them.

**Research that shaped it:** Verified free-tier limits from official docs. Two findings drive the plan: (1) Tamil speech-to-text support in Gemini is unverified, so a spike comes before any build; (2) Gemini free-tier content may be used to improve Google products, which needs a user-facing disclosure.
